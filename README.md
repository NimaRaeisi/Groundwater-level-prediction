At present, numerous methods have been developed for the extraction of potable water resources, allowing scientists to simulate quantitative and qualitative parameters of these resources. Due to the geographical and climatic characteristics of Iran, this region is located within the drought-prone belt of Asia. In this study, various Artificial Intelligence (AI) models were used to predict groundwater levels. The AI models used in this research are Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The database used in the simulation includes data related on Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Electrical Conductivity (EC), pH, Precipitation (mm), Evaporation (m), Skin reservoir content (m), Calcium (Ca), and Magnesium (Mg) over 8 scenarios. The results indicated that the MLP model, using groundwater quality data, outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy. In the statistical method analysis, the MLP in MLPScenario1 model demonstrated an underestimation performance and was identified as the most accurate model.
